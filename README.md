# Project-4-Tornado Prediction with Machine Learning

# Tonado Prediction Model for the State of Mississippi:

This project is dedicated to developing a machine learning model to predict tornado occurrences in Mississippi. Since 2010, Mississippi has been hit by 693 tornadoes, making it an important area of study for this model.

# Visualization:

The project includes a visualization of the data over the map, providing a geographical context for the tornado events. This visualization aids in understanding the spatial distribution and frequency of tornadoes.

# Machine Learning Model:

We have developed a machine learning model to predict tornadoes in Mississippi. This model is intended to help forecast future tornado events, potentially aiding in emergency response and disaster preparedness.

# Model Testing:

The program will be retested using the RandomOverSampler module to handle imbalanced class distribution in the dataset. This helps ensure that our model performs well, even in scenarios where tornado events are relatively rare.

# Predicting Deaths:

We will also predict deaths against tornadoes using a linear regression model. This can provide valuable information for emergency services and disaster response teams, helping them allocate resources more effectively during a tornado event.

# Multiple Predictions:

The program will be tested against multiple predictions to evaluate its performance across a range of potential scenarios.

# Random Forest Model:

Lastly, we will be making predictions using a Random Forest model. This model is known for its robustness and accuracy in handling complex datasets, making it a suitable choice for this prediction task.
