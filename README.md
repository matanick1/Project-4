# Project-4-Tornado Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict tornado occurrences using machine learning, based on weather data like temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. By analyzing historical weather patterns, the program helps anticipate potential tornado threats, promoting safety and preparedness during severe weather events.
The model's accuracy is evaluated using a training-test split.
